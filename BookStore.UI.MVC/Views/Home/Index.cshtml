                A discouraging consequence of living in our consumer society is the high value placed on amusement, novelty, and brand-name trinkets that symbolize success and serve no purpose. "Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Now!" is our culture's mantra. Instead of purchasing a watch that costs as much as a car to impress strangers, buy a book that will impress itself indelibly on your mind. Challenge your non-existent attention span, put down your phone, and spend your next few evenings engaging with ideas that have literally changed the world and informed how we view reality.

            <p class="mb-5">And for those of you who love books as much as I do, hopefully you'll experience the excitement of a "rare find," see a tantalizing title, or finally open a book by that author you've always wanted to read. I firmly believe authors seek readers as much as readers seek authors.</p>
